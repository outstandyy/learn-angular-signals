# What are signals? #


A signal is a wrapper around a value that can notify interested consumers when that value changes. Signals can contain any value, from simple primitives to complex data structures.

A signal's value is always read through a getter function, which allows Angular to track where the signal is used.

Signals may be either writable or read-only.
